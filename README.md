# GPU Raytracing

I am trying to create a basic raytracer on that can run on the GPU. I am initially planning on just using fragment shaders but I will probably add support for the compute shader so that it is more flexible. 
I am also following the game engine series of 'Cherno' not to make a game engine but to get a better idea of code organization.

## Objectives
[] Make a funcitoning ray tracer.
[] Add camera and ability to move around in the scene.
[] Add support for other APIs.

## Things I Want to Learn
[] How to properly handle events. Event Manager.
[] How to write a decent API.
[] How do Application, Window, Renderer fit into an extensible code architecture?
